The **Aloft data portal** is a community-driven initiative to provide access to biological data derived from European weather radars. It is maintained by members of the radar aeroecology community as part several research projects, such as [ENRAM](http://www.enram.eu), [GloBAM](https://globam.science), [CROW](https://inbo.github.io/crow/) and [HiRAD](https://hirad.science).

For more information on the data, see the [FAQ](/faq/).
