## About

The **Aloft data repository** (previously "ENRAM data repository") contains bird movement data extracted by European weather radars. You can directly visualize the data in your browser, browse what data is available or download data to your own computer.

Aloft data repository is a community driven initiative to provide open access to bird movement data from European weather radars. It was developed by the [Open Science lab for biodiversity](https://oscibio.inbo.be) in collaboration, and with funding from, several research projects such as [GloBAM](https://globam.science), [ENRAM](http://www.enram.eu) and [CROW](https://inbo.github.io/crow/).

The repository contains vertical profiles of birds (VP) generated by [vol2bird](https://github.com/adokter/vol2bird) from volume scans. More information on how to browse, download, and use these data can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/aloftdata/data-repository).
